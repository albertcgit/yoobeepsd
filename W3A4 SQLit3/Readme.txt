University Database

The Course Management System is designed to store and display information about teachers, students, courses, and enrollments at Yoobee Colleges. The program uses a SQLite database and Python functions to perform tasks such as storing data, querying information, and printing counts of students and teachers teaching the course MSE800. This system allows administrators and staff to quickly access course-related information and maintain accurate records of enrollments and teaching assignments.

The project folder contains the following files:
1. Text / README file – Contains the scenario description and overview of the system.
2. Database design file – An ER diagram screenshot showing the relationships between teachers, students, courses, and enrollments.
3. Source code and database file – Python source code implementing the system functions and the SQLite database file storing the actual data.
